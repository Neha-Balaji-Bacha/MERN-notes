>>> Inline inside Block
 -Allowed
 -This is normal and correct. Example: <p><a href="#">Click me</a></p>

 >>> Block inside Inline
Not recommended / invalid  allows it but semantically wrong
Example: <a><div>text</div></a> — it might work, but browser auto-fixes it internally.

>>> novalidate : the browser skips all these checks — it sends the form without any validation.


>>> required autocomplete
The required attribute is used to make a form field mandatory.
If a user tries to submit the form without filling this field, 
the browser will prevent submission and show a warning.
user must fill this before submission (if novalidate is not present).

>>> <form>
  <label>Username:</label>
  <input type="text" name="username" required autocomplete="on">

  <label>Email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" required autocomplete="off">

  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

-Username → mandatory, browser can suggest previous entries.

-Email → mandatory, browser will not suggest anything.

>>> placeholder

The placeholder attribute shows temporary text inside an input field.

It gives a hint to the user about what to enter.

The text disappears when the user starts typing.
