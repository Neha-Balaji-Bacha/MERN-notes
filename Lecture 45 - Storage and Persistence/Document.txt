-Why Browser Storage Is Required ?
They do NOT remember data after:
Refresh
Reopen
Navigation ,so browser required storage.

-What is Web Storage API?
It provides two storage mechanisms:
1. ocalStorage
2. sessionStorage

Both store data as key–value pairs
Both store strings only
Both are synchronous
