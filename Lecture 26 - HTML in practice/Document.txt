>>> Javascript some concepts
- document.getElementById("count") : Fetches elements by their id.
- incrementBtn.addEventListener("click", () => { ... }) : Runs code when a user clicks the button.
- let cnt = 0;
  cnt++;
  cnt--;
  cnt = 0;
  Stores and updates the counter value dynamically.
- count.textContent = cnt : Updates the paragraph text to show new counter value.
- name.textContent = prompt("Tell us your name") : prompt() collects input directly from the user.



>>> What happens if you write HTML tags in uppercase like <DIV> instead of <div>?
Works fine — HTML is case-insensitive.
