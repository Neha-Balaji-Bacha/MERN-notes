What is Oop's ?
It helps in organizing data and behavior together, making code reusable, scalable, and easier to maintain.
OOP is mainly based on four principles: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction.
EX : all cars have properties like color, model, speed, and methods like start() and stop().
We can create many car objects from this class.
It represents real-world behavior in code.

1. Encapsulation
Encapsulation means protecet sensitive data and methods inside a class and restrict direct access to some components.
Ex.Encapsulation protect internal data like balance using private fields and exposes only required methods like deposit or Balance.

2.Inheritance
Inheritance allows one class to inherit/acquire the properties and behaviors of another class.
It promotes code reuse
- JavaScript does NOT allow accessing  private field in another class’s.
Ex. animals (is a relation)

-this always refers to the child instance, even when used inside the parent class. JavaScript initializes the child object first 
and passes it through the parent constructor, so both constructors work on the same object.
-We use super() to call the parent constructor so the child class inherits the parent’s properties correctly.
- If a child class has a constructor and you don’t call super(), JavaScript will throw an error.
-JavaScript requires the parent constructor to run before using this in the child.
-When super() runs, JavaScript creates the Child instance first, then calls the Parent constructor on that SAME object.

Code reuse
Avoid duplication
Share common logic
Build hierarchies

3.Polymorphism
Polymorphism means ‘many forms’.
When the same method name performs different actions depending on the object calling it.
Ex. Payment system

4.Composition
Composition means creating complex objects by combining simpler objects, instead of using inheritance.
It represents a “has-a” relationship
Ex. Example: A car has a engine.
Composition is when one object contains another object.
A Car has an Engine. This avoids deep inheritance and makes code flexible.
