All checkboxes:
document.querySelectorAll("input[type=checkbox]")

>>when checked used
Only selected checkboxes:
document.querySelectorAll("input[type=checkbox]:checked")

| Input Type              | How to check selection | Why?                    |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Checkbox                |    checked             | Has ON/OFF state        |
| Radio                   |    checked             | Only one can be ON      |
| Select dropdown         |    selected            | Multiple items possible |
| Text/password/date/time |    value               | Always one typed value  |


=============FileReader============

document.querySelector("[type=file]").value : provides fake path
document.querySelector("[type=file]").files : The REAL file is stored in .files

When a user selects a file, the browser provides a File object inside the input’s .files list. 
This object contains only metadata—such as name, size, and type—not the actual file content. For security reasons, 
JavaScript cannot access the file’s content directly, so we use the FileReader API to read the real data.
FileReader works asynchronously, meaning it reads the file in the background without blocking other JavaScript code. 
It can return the file data in different formats such as text, ArrayBuffer, or a Base64 DataURL. Using readAsDataURL(), 
we can convert the file into a Base64-encoded DataURL, which allows us to display images directly in the browser without uploading the file to a server.
A Base64 DataURL is simply a text representation of a file. When we use FileReader.readAsDataURL(), the browser converts the file’s 
binary data into Base64 text wrapped inside a DataURL format. This is especially useful for features like image preview.

FileReader also provides multiple methods depending on what we need:

readAsDataURL() → for Base64 previews (commonly for images)

readAsText() → for reading text-based files (TXT, JSON, CSV)

readAsArrayBuffer() → for binary processing (PDFs, audio, video, raw uploads)

readAsBinaryString() → deprecated, replaced by ArrayBuffer

Overall, FileReader is mainly used for client-side preview or processing, not for uploading. For uploads, 
we directly send the File object using FormData."


======Some Events=========
1. input event

Fires every time the value of an input changes.

Triggers on each keystroke, paste, delete, or modification.

Best for live updates (e.g., live search).

Example:
Typing "Hello" triggers input 5 times.

2. change event

Fires only when the value is changed AND the input loses focus.

For text inputs → fires when user types something and then clicks outside.

For select dropdowns, checkboxes, and radio buttons → fires immediately when selection changes.

Example:
Typing "Hello" triggers change only once when the user clicks away.

3. focus event
Used for highlighting, Show hints (“Password must be 8 characters”).

Example:
Click in the input → focus fires.

4. blur event

Opposite of focus.

Fires when the user leaves an input field.

Used for validation, saving data, or removing highlight.

Example:
Click outside the input → blur fires.

Save draft automatically when input loses focus

Hide hints/help messages

Short 10-second version (Interview-Ready)

input: fires on every keystroke.

change: fires only after value changes and input loses focus.

focus: fires when input gets focus.

blur: fires when input loses focus.



| Event      | When It Fires       | Common Usage                     |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------- |
|   input    | Every keystroke     | live search, password strength   |
|   change   | Final value changed | dropdown select, checkbox, radio |
|   focus    | User enters input   | show hints, highlight            |
|   blur     | User leaves input   | validation, auto-save            |
