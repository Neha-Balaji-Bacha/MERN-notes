1.Synchronous(blocking)
Code runs line by line
Each task waits for the previous one to finish

2.Asynchronous (Non-Blocking)
Long tasks run in background
JS does not wait
Result comes later

-Async is used when a task takes time, such as API calls, file uploads, payments, or autosave.
>>Why async is needed in frontend?
To avoid UI freezing

>>Name 5 real-life async examples
API calls, login, payments, uploads, autosave

>>Is async only for fetch?
No (timers, storage, uploads, DB)

>>callback : A callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is called later.
Callback is passed, not returned
It is executed later, not immediately

>>setTimeout executes callback once after delay. ex : show pop up after 5 sec
setTimeout(callback, delay);
>>setInterval executes callback repeatedly. ex : OTP resend timer
setInterval(callback, delay);
Both are asynchronous.
They use Web APIs.

>> Note : Canceling timers means stopping a setTimeout or setInterval using clearTimeout or clearInterval 
so the callback does not execute.

>> Async in behaviour : listeners(wait for user action),setInterval,setTimeout
