1. What are they?
call(), apply(), and bind() are function methods in JavaScript.
Every function automatically has access to them because they come from:
Function.prototype

2. Why do we need them?
Because in JavaScript, this is dynamic and depends on how a function is called.
These methods allow us to manually control this.

=== call()====
The function executes immediately.
Arguments are passed one by one (comma-separated).
this is set temporarily only for that execution.

====apply()===
The function executes immediately (same as call).
Arguments must be passed inside an array.
this is also set temporarily only during this call.

====bind()====
The function does NOT execute immediately.
It returns a new function.
Arguments are passed like call() (comma-separated).
this becomes permanently bound to the object for all future calls of that new function.

event.target : The actual clicked element
event.currentTarget	: The element that has the event listener (parent)
element.matches() is a very useful method when you want to check whether the clicked child matches a specific selector.return boolean val.

=========Event Delegation===============
stopPropagation() prevents the event from traveling further along the propagation path.
- Which direction “further” means depends on the current phase:

- If called during capturing, it prevents the event from continuing downward to later capture 
listeners and prevents reaching the target and the later bubbling phase.

- If called during the target phase, it prevents the event from entering the bubbling phase 
(so ancestor listeners in bubbling won’t run).

- If called during the bubbling phase, it prevents the event from continuing upward to ancestor 
listeners that haven’t run yet.but other listeners on the same element still run.
this all correct i think but target how differently work other than bubbling phase

What it stops:
Capturing : stops before reaching target.
Target : stops bubbling.
Bubbling : stops moving to ancestor listeners.Default phase

What it does NOT stop:
Other event listeners on the same element.

stopImmediatePropagation() — Stop

Stops:
- Further capturing
- Target phase bubbling
- Prevents other listeners on same element from running
