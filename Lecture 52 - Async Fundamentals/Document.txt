setTimeout

After the delay finishes, the callback is executed once.
All code inside it runs completely, then it’s done.
If cleared before the delay finishes, it never enters the queue.

✔ Correct.

Callback is added to the queue only after the delay ends

Runs once

No repeated queue buildup

✅ setInterval

During the delay, the timer keeps ticking.
If the task takes long, callbacks can go into the queue while the previous one is still running.

✔ Correct.

Timer is clock-based

Does not wait for task completion

If JS is busy → callbacks wait in the queue

Can cause queue buildup


const id = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Won't run");
  clearTimeout(id);
}, 2000);

const id = setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Won't run");
}, 2000);
 clearTimeout(id);


const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Won't run");
  clearInterval(id);
}, 2000);

const id = setInterval(() => {
  console.log("Won't run");
}, 2000);
 clearInterval(id);
