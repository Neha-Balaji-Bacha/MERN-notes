what is class ?
class is used for grouping prototype,constructor and meth.
Classes provide a clean, organized, reusable structure for creating multiple objects.
They make code easier to maintain, especially compared to old prototype-based syntax.
A class acts like a blueprint for creating objects.
class is not hoisted before execute body

>>Note : prototype and class both are same working only difference is it provide cleaner syntax

-this in Classes
In a class, this refers to the newly created object instance.
The value of this depends on how a function is called, not where it is defined.

>> Constructor inside class
Only one constructor allowed per class.
If not defined, JavaScript creates an empty constructor.

>>prototype inside class
Methods defined inside the class automatically go to the prototype.

==============Getter & Setter (Encapsulation)===========
Why used?
To implement encapsulation.
Getter : read value safely.
Setter : update value with validation or extra logic.
Hides internal implementation while keeping clean property-like syntax.

::Rules
Getter must return a value.otherwise returns undefined.
Setter must take exactly one parameter.
Both use same property name.
No parentheses when accessing.
Stored on the prototype.
Getter/Setter work with both objects & classes.

>> Why property like _name?
To prevent recursion:
set name(v) { this.name = v }  //infinite loop
Solution:
set name(v) { this._name = v }

>>Drawbacks of getter and setter
Do NOT provide true privacy
_name is just a naming convention; still accessible from outside.
Need private fields (#) for actual security
Getter/Setter only control access, they don’t hide the data.

===========private fields==========

What are private fields?
The class properties private declared with #.
Cannot be accessed outside the class.
It can be property or method

:: Rules
Must be declared in class body.
Cannot be accessed outside class : SyntaxError.
Each object instance gets its own private copy.
Changing one object’s private data does not affect others.
so private field belong to individual obj instance

>> Why used?
To protect sensitive data like PIN, balance, password.
Getter/Setter allow access outside access.
Perfect for encapsulation + security.

=======What is static?===========
Belongs to class, not instance.
Access using ClassName.property.
Cannot access instance data (this) inside static.

Used for:
Shared values (ex. companyName)
Utility functions

:: Rules
Call using Class.method(), not obj.method().
Not copied to instances.
Cannot access static via object.

====why used destructuring=====
Why used?
Makes constructor cleaner.
Extracts multiple values from one object.
Allows default values.
Safe even if some values are missing.
when we have arr obj data
